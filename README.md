# Hardware for ESP IoT Framework

This repository contains the essential Gerber-files or CAD drawings which where utilized for creating a test application of the [ESP-IoT-Framework](https://github.com/ECE-IoT/esp-iot-framework) and the [AWS-IoT-Framework](https://github.com/ECE-IoT/aws-iot-framework)

## Motivation

### Overview

The networking of sensors and actuators via the internet is becoming increasingly important in industry, but also in the private sector. In this project work it will be shown how a processing chain from the sensor to the cloud service (AWS) can be realized practically. The project aims to provide a valuable overview of what is possible with embedded/connected IoT devices that can transmit data to the cloud. In addition, the projects goal was to provide a secure connection to AWS.

> Please be aware that this project is a feasibility study. It does not provide code which is ready for production, or similar. Further information about the future intentions of this project can be found here.
